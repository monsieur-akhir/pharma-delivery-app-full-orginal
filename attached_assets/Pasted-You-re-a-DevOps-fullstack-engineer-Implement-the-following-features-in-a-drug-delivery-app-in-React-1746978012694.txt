You're a DevOps fullstack engineer. Implement the following features in a drug delivery app in React Native (Expo) with NestJS back-end.

üîß 1. Logging Backend (NestJS)
Goal: Ensure that all back-end actions are properly logged for debugging, traceability and auditing and also that all api are accessible I don't want a simplified or minimal version, I want a complex and robust full version.

Re-establish a global logger (e.g. LoggerService custom or nestjs-pino)

Log all incoming HTTP requests (method, route, IP, user agent, etc.)

Log errors with stack trace

Log business events (e.g. OTP generation, login, order creation, etc.).

üåê 2. API Accessibility
Checks that all expected API routes are exposed in Swagger (/docs) and testable.

Check that CORS are properly configured for web/mobile apps

Make sure that the documentation is synchronised with the actual routes

Possibility of adding global middleware to log and control access.

üìç 3. Delivery tracking using geolocation
Functionality:

Real-time tracking of the deliverer's position on the map on the customer side.

Regular position updates via WebSocket or REST polling.

Backend:

API to receive the delivery driver's GPS coordinates (lat/lng + userId + timestamp)

Temporary storage in Redis for high frequency or persistence in DB if required

Mobile (deliverer) :

GPS permission with Expo

Coordinates sent periodically (every 5-10 sec) via background task

Mobile (customer) :

Map display with real time position of the deliverer

üì± 4. Mobile App improvement (React Native + Expo)
UI/UX:

Improve login screens (OTP), orders, and tracking.

Use React Navigation, React Query, AsyncStorage for state/session management

Integration of TypeScript SDK generated automatically from Swagger

Display tracking in real time via react-native-maps and WebSocket

üéØ Objective
To create a robust, traceable and fluid mobile + back-office solution, with real-time delivery tracking, full logs and a high-quality user experience.
